              Denise St. Jean is a health strategy expert and Project Leader at <em>Boston Consulting Group</em>, where she advises biopharma, biotech, and public sector clients on evidence generation, 
              pipeline planning, and R&D strategy. Her career bridges quantitative research and real-world application—shaped by nearly a decade of work in <em>epidemiology, clinical trials,
              and health systems innovation</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Denise earned her PhD in Epidemiology (with a concentration in Infectious Diseases) from <em>the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
              Gillings School of Global Public Health</em> where she was a Flare Capital Scholar and 
              <a href="https://jphmpdirect.com/students-who-rocked-public-health-2021" target="_blank">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy Research Scholar</a>.
              Her dissertation applied advanced causal inference methods to clinical trial and demographic survey data to estimate real-world effectiveness of oral rotavirus vaccine across settings. 
              Her research has been published in <em>Vaccine</em>, <em>Epidemiology & Infection</em>, and <em>Journal of Infectious Diseases</em>. 
              She was recognized by the <a href="https://healthpolicyresearch-scholars.org/meet-the-scholars-denise-st-jean" target="_blank">Journal of Public Health Management and Practice</a> 
              as a “Student Who Rocked Public Health” for her research to understand COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Prior to earning her PhD, Denise was an Analyst at <em>Beghou Consulting</em> and earned her BS from Yale University where she investigated the spread of non-disseminating 
              strains of Lyme disease and Babesiosis as an <em>Edward A. Bouchet Research Fellow</em>. She also holds an MS in Management from Wake Forest University where she was a 
              <em>PepsiCo Corporate Fellow</em>. Across these roles, she has built a reputation for translating rigorous evidence into actionable strategies that advance population health.
