        Denise St. Jean is a health strategy expert and Project Leader at <em>Boston Consulting Group</em>, where she advises biopharma, biotech, and public sector clients on evidence generation, 
        pipeline planning, and R&D strategy. Her career bridges quantitative research and real-world application—shaped by nearly a decade of work in <strong>epidemiology, clinical trials,
        and health systems innovation</strong>. Denise earned her PhD in Epidemiology (with a concentration in Infectious Diseases) from <em>the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
        Gillings School of Gloal Public Health </em> where she was a Flare Capital Scholar and 
        <em><a href="https://jphmpdirect.com/students-who-rocked-public-health-2021" target="_blank">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy Research Scholar</a></em>.
        Her dissertation applied advanced causal inference methods to clinical trial and demographic survey data to estimate real-world effectiveness of oral rotavirus vaccine across settings. 
        Her research has been published in <em>Vaccine</em>, <em>Epidemiology & Infection</em>, and <em>Journal of Infectious Diseases</em>. 
        She was recognized by the <em><a href="https://healthpolicyresearch-scholars.org/meet-the-scholars-denise-st-jean" target="_blank"> Journal of Public Health Management and Practice</a></em> 
        as a “Student Who Rocked Public Health” for her research to understand COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.
        Prior to earning her PhD, Denise was an Analyst at <em>Beghou Consulting</em> and earned her BS from Yale University where she investigated the spread of non-disseminating 
        strains of Lyme disease and Babesiosis as an <em>Edward A. Bouchet Research Fellow</em>. She also holds an MS in Management from Wake Forest University where she was a 
        <em>PepsiCo Corporate Fellow</em>. Across these roles, she has built a reputation for translating rigorous evidence into actionable strategies that advance population health.
